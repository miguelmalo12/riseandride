# RISE & RIDE

## Overview
I've always thought that **software is here to make our lives easier** and help us on our daily routines, so I built this app to help me decide what to wear on my daily commute to work. Using React Native, **the app provides a quick view to the weather forecasts at two different times of the day (when I ride my bike) and throws a personalized outfit recommendation based on the data.** Hence, Rise & Ride simplifies my decision-making every morning with just one click, making my commuting more comfortable and enjoyable.

## Features
**Dual Time Weather Forecasts:** Displays weather information for the two relevant times: 9 AM and 5 PM. This feature helps me understand the weather conditions I will face during my commute to and from work.

**Customized Weather Data:** Shows the weather data that is most relevant to me, like temperature, chance of precipitation, wind speed, etc.

**Outfit Recommendation Algorithm:** Based on the weather data, the app uses a personalized algorithm to suggest what clothes should I wear or bring with me.

**Visuals:** 
All the information relevant to me is presented in one screen with just one click, using icons and colors to help visualize all the information at a glance.

## How It Works
**Fetch Weather Data:** The app retrieves weather data from a reliable API, focusing on the specific times of 9 AM and 5 PM.

**Analyze Conditions:**  It then analyzes this data, emphasizing parameters crucial for my commute.

**Generate Recommendation:**  Based on this analysis, the app provides an outfit tailored to the expected weather conditions.
